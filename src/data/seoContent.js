From the beginning, he was more than just a pet; he became our inspiration and a beloved member of the family.\n\nWe dedicated ourselves to training Tito as a mobility assistance service dog, with a focus on both obedience and task-specific skills.\n\nOur training program included:\nDesensitization to various environments and stimuli\nObedience training with impulse control\nPositive reinforcement to encourage calm, focused behavior\n\nToday, Tito is a well-mannered, confident dog. He enjoys his daily off-leash walks, responds reliably to commands, and stays relaxed in busy social settings. Most importantly, he now assists with mobility-related tasks, including counterbalance support, retrieving objects, chest press and bringing medication.\n\nTito's transformation highlights the impact of early training, patience, and purpose-driven work — he's not only a loyal companion but a life-changing partner.",
