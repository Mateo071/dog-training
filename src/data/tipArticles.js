    content: `One of the most common challenges dog owners face is leash pulling. A peaceful walk with your dog should be enjoyable, not a constant battle. Here's how to teach your dog to walk politely on a leash:

1. Start in a low-distraction environment
2. Hold treats close to your hip
3. When your dog stays by your side, reward them frequently
4. If they pull, stop walking immediately
5. Only continue walking when the leash is loose
6. Be consistent with your training
7. Practice for short periods multiple times a day

Remember, this training requires patience and consistency. Some dogs may take weeks to master loose-leash walking, while others might need months.`
